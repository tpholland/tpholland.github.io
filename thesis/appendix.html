                        <h3 id="about-the-texts" class="unnumbered">About the texts</h3>
                        <p>The ‘Cantelman Crowd-Master’ manuscript fragments and complete typescript are now in Cornell University Library.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sections of ‘Cantelman Crowd-Master’ were published in <em>Unlucky for Pringle</em> and <em>Enemy News</em>, but these fragments of the story don’t adequately reflect what is a reasonably polished narrative that differs significantly other available texts, and even from the <em>Blasting and Bombardiering</em> fragments.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> My reading texts makes the whole available for the first time.</p>
                        <p>The opening sections of the manuscript resemble part I, chapter VI, and part II, chapters II, III, and IV of <em>Blasting and Bombardiering</em>: Cantelman (—his name is regularized as ‘Cantleman’ in the <em>Blasting and Bombardiering</em> version) is in Scotland, at a country-house party; he travels down to London during the mobilization, where he observes the crowds.</p>
                        <p>The manuscript continues with Cantelman in London. He meets Cedric Morkdine in the street, who praises Cantelman’s potboiler, <em>Bryan Multum</em>; they drink beer in the Soho Distillery and have a typically combative discussion. Cantelman then visits Mr and Mrs Stevens, with whom he lodges when in town. He spies on a girl across the street, who is brushing her hair in front of a mirror, naked, and again his novel is praised.</p>
                        <p>Months later, a friend, Pringle visits, and looks at something Cantelman has written. This is ‘The Code of a Herdsman’, which completes the ‘Cantelman Crowd-Master’ manuscript. Lewis had published the ‘Code’ in a slightly different form in <em>The Little Review</em> in July 1917, as part of the series of ‘Imaginary Letters’ written by Pound and himself; there, it had purported to be ‘a set of rules sent by Benjamin Richard Wing to his young friend Philip Seddon enclosed with a letter.’ A few months later it was included in his book, <em>The Ideal Giant</em>, which also included ‘Cantelman’s Spring-Mate.’<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The table on the following page should simplify things a little:</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>There are two copies of the Cantelman typescript in the Cornell archive: one is a carbon copy of the other; both have the same annotations, in Lewis’s hand on the originals and in another hand on the carbon copy.</p>
                        <p>The typescript is presented here in its entirety. The final section, ‘The Code of a Herdsman’ is typed up from pages torn from a printed copy of <em>The Ideal Giant</em>, also in the Cornell collection. These pages have been annotated in Lewis’s hand, and the annotations incorporated in the final typescript.</p>
                        <p>This text presents all of Lewis’s annotations to the typescript, with my editorial corrections. I have used three levels of footnotes: a top level, showing my own interventions; a second level, printed in double columns, which shows Lewis’s autograph corrections, and, at some points, a third level with my editorial notes.</p>
                        <p>I have shown Lewis’s own typescript annotations throughout. However, readers should note that the double column apparatus in the ‘Code of a Herdsman’ section indicates annotations made by Lewis on the pages torn from the printed <em>Ideal Giant</em> text. The ‘Code’ was also published in the <em>Little Review</em>: there are several variant readings between the two published versions, which I have duly marked in the double column apparatus—their provenance is clearly marked.</p>
                        <p>Marginal notes indicate breaks in the typescript pages: TSA = the complete Cornell typescript; IG = <em>The Ideal Giant</em> printing of ‘The Code of a Herdsman’; LR = <em>Little Review</em> printing of ‘The Code of a Herdsman’</p>
                        <p>I have attempted to show all significant alterations made by Lewis in a fairly pedantic—but not overly pedantic fashion. My own corrections, as well as correcting spellings and typographic errors, go so far as to normalise capitalisation—which Lewis uses inconsistently, and which some editors have argued should be preserved—in favour of common practice. All of my corrections are clearly marked in the footnotes.</p>

                                slowly forward, as mechanically as possible. He reached Charing Cross, then the end 
                                of the Strand. Trafalgar Square was an extensive human lake. He moved towards the 
                                Nelson Column. He might obtain a valuable note if he climbed up onto the plinth. 
                                Hoarse voices were muttering all round him. He felt the pressure of the visible 
                                ghosts whom he was inviting to inscribe their ideas on the tabula rasa he offered them.

                                Their messages continued to be extremely confused. He noticed he had lost ground, even. 
                                He felt more and more solitary, therefore 
                                <em>single</em> and so divorced.

                                On the plinth of the Nelson Column he strained for a distinct sensation. Nothing came 
                                at all. He strained again. He felt as detached as the stone Nelson. What a change

                                Cecil Court because its bookshops were frequented in the 30s by Lewis's compatriots, Geoffrey Grigson and 
                                Ruthven Todd. See Geoffrey Grigson, \textit{Recollections: Mainly of Writers \& Artists} (London: Chatto

                                Mordkine' is named `Sydney Modker'. In the course of drafting, Lewis quickly amends this to `Modkine', and then 
                                `Mordkine'. The early form of the name makes the cruel characature of John Rodker much clearer. Rodker, the poet
                                and publisher, shares Mordkine's East-End Jewish background. Lewis doesn't seem to have met Rodker until some time in 
                                1915 when he was putting together \textit{Blast 2}—he wrote to Pound: `I found Rodker a most poisonous little 
                                bugger\ldots repellently hoarse (this may be a form of jealousy) \& with abominable teeth, not to mention his 
                                manners.\ldots He told me he had written a lot of filthy sexual verse, which, if he sends it, I shall hang
                                in the W. C. He described it as Verlainesque, damn his dirty little eyes.'

                                They all laughed.

                                “Who did you write the conversation in the hat-store for, Mr. Cantelman?” asked the 
                                lodger. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                “Oh.—I wrote that because I heard it.” 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                “And how about the death of the old father after the wake?” 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                Cantelman looked at him with the good-natured grin of a man who is being got at, of 
                                patient puzzled enquiry. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                “Well, old men have to die, in books as elsewhere.” 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                “Surely” said the lodger. ”I thought that a masterly piece of writing!” 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                There was a heavy silence. Cantelman gazed with open shame at the same flower on the 
                                carpet as Mrs.

                                said Mr. Stevens in a respectful dignified voice, “I

                                In the mews at the back there was a burst of shouting. They listened.

                                <p>

                                “What are they crying?” asked Mrs. Stevens. “Oh Fred do get a paper! I should like to 
                                see what they are calling out.” 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                Fred got up, Cantelman got up too.

                                “I must go” he said.

                                Mr. Gillespie held out his hand—he was humble and practical, it was his turn!—his 
                                eyes put the maximum of intelligent recognition into the few seconds of the handshake. 
                                Cantelman passed out like a heavy lord, stooping slightly beneath the doorway. 
                                </p>

                                that said a lot of nice things about it.—Has it gone well?”

                                As they issued into the street the urgent bawling figures of the newsboys appeared 
                                round the corner, with one paper trailing like a broken white wing, hastening forward 
                                selling copies as they went without stopping. What they were shouting was what they had 
                                been shouting earlier at Oxford Circus. Cantelman left Mr. Stevens as he hurried to 
                                intercept the nearest of them.

                                Eight months after the declaration of war Cantelman was lying in bed in the room he 
                                had formerly occupied with the Stevens. His lunch had just been brought from the

                                A slow and heavy foot sounded on the stairs. The door opened and a man smiling 
                                heavily and silently at Cantelman entered and with husky hunching of shoulders 
                                closed the door without noise behind him—a genial

                                with his large teeth and eyes. Just “Hello” in a little light nasal familiar voice,

                                The main thing, however, is, on principle, to lie very badly and imperfectly when you 
                                must. You cannot lie crudely and stupidly enough. \emph{This is in order to protect and 
                                secure your own reality}. Bear that of cousrse in mind. As soon as you begin acquiring 
                                any skill or artistry in lying, cultivating the talent of the comedian, then goodbye 
                                to your own reality. For the personality lives upon the surface, and 
                                <em>cannot</em> flourish 
                                in a subterranean life, where it is never able to sun and air itself. This you 
                                may take absolutely for granted.—If I insist a great deal on this point, there is 
                                certaintly no moral purpose in mind.

                                compunction where lying is concerned. It is purely to yourself that you must not 
                                be untruthful. To practice to deceive is to engage yourself to some extent to the 
                                forms that you adopt. However, this is enough. These are all rules for acquiring or 
                                retaining 
                                <em>reality</em> or self-hood. I might have put this real first.

                                There is certainly one point that may be added to this instruction. You will be forced 
                                to lie, in one form or another, in most cases, because it will be the only way, you 
                                will find of conveying the truth. The majority of people will have no means whatever 
                                of receiving your 
                                <em>truth</em>. It would seem the purest hebrew to them. Under the circumstances 
                                it is scarcely so much a question of 
                                <em>lying</em> as of

                                the truth as they can stomach, or are ever likely to be able to swallow, along with 
                                a great deal of material that is necessarily false. So you will have not an envelope 
                                or coating, of the
